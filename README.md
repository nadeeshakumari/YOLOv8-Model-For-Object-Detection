# 🌊 Underwater Plastic Detection using YOLOv8

This repository demonstrates how to train a YOLOv8 model to detect underwater plastic waste using the [Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) library. The project uses the **Underwater Plastic Pollution Detection** dataset and visualizes training results with **high-resolution performance plots**.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ YOLOv8 training on underwater plastic detection dataset
- 🏋️‍♂️ 50 epochs of model training on annotated images
- 📈 Visual analysis: results, predictions, confusion matrix, and evaluation curves
- 🖼️ All plots saved as **high-resolution PNG and SVG**
- 🧰 Works on Kaggle or any notebook environment
